## Host Multiple TensorFlow computer vision models using Amazon SageMaker Multi-model endpoint

Amazon SageMaker Multi-Model Endpoints provides a scalable and cost-effective way to deploy large numbers of custom machine learning models. SageMaker Multi-Model endpoints will let you deploy multiple ML models on a single endpoint and serve them using a single serving container. Your application simply needs to include an API call with the target model to this endpoint to achieve low latency, high throughput inference. Instead of paying for a separate endpoint for every single model, you can host many models for the price of a single endpoint. For detailed information about multi-model endpoints, see Save on inference costs by using Amazon SageMaker multi-model endpoints.

In this repository, we demonstrate how to host two computer vision models trained using the TensorFlow framework under one SageMaker multi-model endpoint.  For the first model, we train a smaller version of AlexNet CNN to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. For the second model, we use a pretrained VGG16 CNN model pretrained on the ImageNet dataset and fine-tuned on the Sign Language Digits Dataset to classify hand symbol images. 

### Model-1: CIFAR-10 image classification
CIFAR-10 is a benchmark dataset for image classification in the CV and ML literature. CIFAR images are colored (three channels) with dramatic variation in how the objects appear. It consists of 32×32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. There are 50,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Figure below shows a sample of the images grouped by the labels.

### Model-2: Sign language digits classification 
For model-2, we will use the sign language digits dataset. This dataset distinguishes the sign language digits from 0 to 9. The figure below shows a sample of the dataset. 
Following are the details of the dataset: 
•	Number of classes = 10 (digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) 
•	Image size = 100 × 100
•	Color space = RGB
•	1,712 images in the training set 
•	300 images in the validation set
•	50 images in the test set
